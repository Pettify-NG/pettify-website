                <p>
                    I grew up surrounded by dogs, my dad was a local breeder and our first family pet, a greyhound named Jet was much more than just a dog, he was my childhood companion, always by my side, running errands with me and brightening every day. But on January 18, 2002, Jet wandered off and never came back. Losing him left a deep void in my heart, and since then, I have been searching for a pet like Jet, a companion that feels like family.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the years, I realized just how difficult it was for others to find pets, especially one that matched their lifestyle and personality. The traditional ways of finding breeders or pet vendors were limited, often long and inconvenient, considering that you have to first find a breeder or wait for someone to help you import, it also lacked the variety people wanted. People had to rely on word of mouth, drive long distances, or settle for fewer choices simply because there was no better way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We started Pettify to solve these pain points to bring convenience, choice, and peace of mind to pet lovers. With Pettify, buyers can easily find trusted breeders and vendors close to their location, compare a variety of pets, and make their choice without hassle. Whether you're a remote worker or creative looking for a loyal companion or a family searching for the perfect pet to add joy to your home, Pettify makes the process simple, safe, and tailored to your needs. We've built a platform that puts control back into the hands of pet lovers, making it easier than ever to shop from trusted sellers, discover the perfect pet, and bring home not just an animal, but a companion that will improve your life. My journey started with Jet, and through Pettify, We want to help others find their own Jets—pets that fill our lives with love, loyalty, and companionship.
